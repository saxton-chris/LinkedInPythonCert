Python is one of the most commonly used dynamic languages for many large organizations, including Google, Yahoo, and IBM. Supported on all major operating systems, it comes pre-installed on Macs, as well as most Linux and Unix-based systems. In this course, senior software engineer Ryan Mitchell guides you through all the essentials of learning and using Python. Learn how computers think, as well as how to install Python, pip, and Jupyter Notebook and the basics of writing a program. Explore variables and types, operators, functions, classes, objects, and more. Go over basic data types like ints and floats, Booleans, and strings. Deep dive into basic data structures, control flow, functions, classes, and objects. Find out how to handle errors and exceptions, as well as threads and processes. Plus, discover how to work with different types of files in Python, pass command-line arguments to your Python script, and create modules and packages.

## Chapter 1
This was just an introductory and setup chapter. Walked through what Python is and how to install Python, Pip, and Jupyter.

Was then given a breif over view of Jupyter and Python and given stepwise instructions on how to create a `hello world` program

## Chapter 2
This chapter covered the fundamentals of coding in Python. It covered topics of variables, data structures, and operators. It then when over the basic of control flow using if/else statements and loops. The section ended with a very quick over view of fuinctions and classes that will be build on in later chapters.

The [coding project](https://github.com/saxton-chris/LinkedInPythonCert/tree/main/my_work/Chapter_02) was to write a robust function to calculate factorials without using the build in `math.factorial()` function. 

## Chapter 3
This chapter covered the basic data structures of Python. This included `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, and `byte`.

The [coding project](https://github.com/saxton-chris/LinkedInPythonCert/tree/main/my_work/Chapter_03) for this chapter was to create a function that convereted hex numbers to decimal. The goal was to only support at most a 3 digit hex number, but I wrote my code in a way to be robust enough to handle any length. It includes checks to make sure the input is a valid hex number before attemtping to conver to decimal.

## Chapter 4
This chatper is an intro to the basic data structures in Python

* **List** - A `list` is a mutable and ordered sequence of elements in Python. Items can be added and removed from the list as needed.
* **Tuple** - A `tuple` is ordered but immutable. Once the tuple has been created it cannot be changed. If you want to add elements you can convert it to a `list` and manipulate the `list`, but would need to create a new `tuple` to convert it back to a `tuple`
* **Set** - A `set` is an unordered and mutable collection of items. The order in a `set` is not guarunteed and there cannot be repeated elements in the `set`
* **Dictionary** - A `dictionary` stores data in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are mutable and can store other data types or structures.

The chapter concluded with going over the basics of list and dictionary comprehensions.
